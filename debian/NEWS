tinyca (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * TinyCA has been rewritten to use perl-gkt2.  Due to this change the
    author of tinyca has renamed the executable to "tinyca2".  In order to
    avoid unnecessary clutter, I will stay with the new name and not
    introduce a compatibility symlink.
  
    From now on, please invoke tinyca as tinyca2.
